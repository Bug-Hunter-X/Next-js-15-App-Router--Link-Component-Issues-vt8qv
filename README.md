# Next.js 15 App Router: Link Component Issues

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Next.js 15 App Router's Link component. In certain scenarios, especially involving dynamic routes or nested layouts, the navigation behavior might not align with expectations. 

## Bug Description
Links in the application might fail to navigate correctly, leading to unexpected page rendering or broken navigation. The problem could manifest as a failure to transition to the intended route, or perhaps navigation to an unintended location.  This typically occurs when dealing with complex route structures within an app directory.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the navigation behavior.  The `bug.js` file shows a simple implementation, but more complex setups may exhibit the issue more clearly.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a potential solution. In this case, the solution might include adjusting the way links are defined, ensuring the correct use of dynamic segments or implementing custom event handling for navigation in specific circumstances.
